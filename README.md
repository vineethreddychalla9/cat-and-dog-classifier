# cat-and-dog-classifier
I have created a machine learning model which can classify an image as an image of an dog or an cat.
Here i have first used some very basic convolution layers in which i have been getting an accuracy of around 80% then after I have used the technique of transfer learning and used the base layers of the model VGG16 and then i have got an accuracy score of 94% which can also be increased by running the model for some more epochs.
I have also saved the model so that anyone can directy use the model without training the model on their systems. 
I have used a very small set of train test and validation sets which are available on Kaggle.
I have also create a function which can make a prediction on new images that we give rather than those images present in train test and validation sets.
